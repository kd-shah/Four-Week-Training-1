        <p>Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. Apple is
            the
            world's largest technology company by revenue, with US$394.3 billion in 2022 revenue.[6] As of March 2023,
            Apple
            is the world's biggest company by market capitalization.[7] As of June 2022, Apple is the fourth-largest
            personal computer vendor by unit sales and the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It is
            considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company
            of
            Google), Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft.</p>

        <p>Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs (1955–2011) and
            Ronald
            Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as
            Apple
            Computer, Inc. in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the
            first
            mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed
            computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced
            that
            year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called "1984". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and
            power
            struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures,
            while
            Jobs resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.</p>

        <p>As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable
            market
            share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also
            known as "Wintel"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's
            unsuccessful
            operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company. Over the next decade, Jobs guided Apple back
            to
            profitability through a number of tactics including introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad to critical
            acclaim, launching the "Think different" campaign and other memorable advertising campaigns, opening the
            Apple
            Store retail chain, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the company's product portfolio. When Jobs
            resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later, he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.</p>
        <p>Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in August 2018, then at
            $2 trillion in August 2020, and at $3 trillion in January 2022. In June 2023, it was valued at just over $3
            trillion.[8] The company receives criticism regarding the labor practices of its contractors, its
            environmental practices, and its business ethics, including anti-competitive practices and materials
            sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of brand loyalty. It has
            also been consistently ranked as one of the world's most valuable brands.</p>
